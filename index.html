  <h1 class="text-primary text-center"><em>Albert Einstein</em></h1>
  <p class="text-info">He was a genius who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics. Einstein is best known by the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc<sup>2</sup> (which has been dubbed "the world's most famous
    equation").</p>

  <p class="text-info text-center">Here is some facts about Einstein's life:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Born: 14 March 1879 in Ulm, Württemberg, Germany</li>
    <li>Died: 18 April 1955 in Princeton, New Jersey, US</li>
    <li>Family:
      <ul class="border">
        <li>Einstein was the eldest child of Hermann Einstein, an electrical engineer and salesman, and Pauline Koch. He had one sister, named Maja.</li>
        <li>Einstein married Mileva Marić in 1903.Together they had two sons. </li>
        <li>After divorcing Einstein married his second wife, Elsa Löwenthal, in 1919.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>His life:
      <ul class="border">
        <li>In 1887 Einstein began his education at the Luitpold Gymnasium (a secondary school) in Munich.</li>
        <li>In 1896, aged 17, Einstein enrolled at Zürich Polytechnic, where he studied for a mathematics and physics teaching diploma. </li>
        <li>In 1905 he completed a doctorate degree from the University of Zurich.</li>
        <li>After demonstrating his impressive work in theoretical physics, Einstein was made a privatdozent in Bern, Switzerland in 1908.</li>
        <li> Einstein’s academic career developed further in 1914 when he became the director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Physics and a professor at the University of Berlin.</li>
        <li>In 1915 Einstein published his work on the general theory of relativity, which suggests that “space and time are woven together, and become distorted by objects with mass”.</li>
        <li>As a result of his outstanding work, in 1921 Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for services to theoretical physics.</li>
        <li> In 1933 he renounced his German citizenship and emigrated to the US, where he became a professor at Princeton University in New Jersey.</li>
        <li>In the 1940s Einstein also became involved in campaigns advocating civil rights in the US, and he joined National Association for the Advancement of Colored People </li>
        <li>In the later years of his life, Einstein continued to work as a theoretical physicist, and he further developed his theory of general relativity.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>In 1999, TIME Magazine named Einstein as the ‘Person of the Century’.</p>
